## 1. Introduction
# Project Name: SAFEHR â€“ Backend Functionality Evaluation 
### (Project focus - Endpoint Framework Migration and Functionality Enhancement)

This project is about the SAFEHR application used by the  Minnesota State University, Mankato School of Nursing Program. The SAFEHR
application is simulated electronic health records that provide students with a virtual environment to practice clinical simulation 
functionalities scenarios.

The software currently runs a deprecated version of the Sencha Torch framework and an older version of Laravel, which no longer has mainstream 
support and has reached its end of life. This makes this program unreliable and an insecure stack of technology.

### Project Purpose and scope
The purpose of the project is to evaluate the current existing backend functionality and source code artifacts. 
- Re-engineer the SAFEHR backend endpoint,
- Migrate the SAFEHR Endpoint to a new mainstream framework and
- Enhance the functionalities

This project will be rebuilt to utilize the following framework:
- Django RESTful API and
- Django REST Framework

The project will be containerized
- Docker Container

The endpoints will be tested
- Postman


## 2. Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. The follow prerequisites

### Prerequisites software
- Python 3.12.3
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MySQL Workbench
- Docker Container
- Git Bash
- Postman

### If you decide to clone the repository, and run in a containerized environment. You do not need a fresh install of the Django and Django REST Framework 



### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
  - Python 3.12.3
3. Run the server
   From git bash, activate the virtual environment.
   cd c" 
   source venv/Script/

   Navigate the manage.py directory
   -
